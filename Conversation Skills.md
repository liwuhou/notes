When you are confused about some words. You can ask a person what they mean.

1. What's ___ ?
2. What does __ mean?

For example:
What's "take a dump"?
What does "donkey" mean?

Also, if there's a word you don't know (or can't remember), you can ask people  these questions:

1. How do you say _(describe the word)_ ?
2. What do you call _describe the word_ ?

For example:
How do you say the food the you sometimes eat at the movies? It's white and yellow. Sometimes, we put butter on it.
What do you call the animal that looks like a horse, but it's a little smaller, and has long ears, and I can ride it?
